# Robopow

For shooting robots- pew pew!!

Robopow is a CAPTCHA-like service that is designed to stop 
DDOS and large-scale automated attacks. It does **not** offer any
protection against malicious users operating at a small scale, or 
who have very large budgets. User beware.

It uses a large number of sha512sum nonce calculations. It's kinda cool I guess.
